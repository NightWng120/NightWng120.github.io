	<h2>Object of the game</h2>
	<p style="word-wrap: break-word">
		The object of Mastermind is to guess the secret 
		color code the computer has generated and to do
		so in 10 attempts or less.
	</p>
	<h2>How to play</h2>
	<p style="word-wrap: break-word">
		With each guess pegs are awarded based on whether
		or not a color guessed is in the code generated by
		the computer. Black pegs are awarded for each correct
		color that is also in the correct position and grey
		pegs are awarded for each peg that is in the code,
		but not in the correct position. Use this information
		to deduce what the computer's code is before you run 
		out of attempts.
